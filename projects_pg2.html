        <h2> Portrait subject, Bollywouldn't</h2>
        <h3>Summer / Autumn 2022</h3>
        <p> I co-developed the concept for the imaginary film Kali Ka Choti Behen, co-writing an excerpt of the film
            script. This was based on my experiences within queer and feminist activist communities. 
            The concept was turned into a portrait created by visual artist TextaQueen as part of their solo
            exhibition <a href="https://4a.com.au/exhibitions/textaqueen-bollywouldnt"
                target="_blank">Bollywouldn't</a>, held at the
            A4 Centre for Contemporary Asian Art in Sydney, Australia. In the portrait, I'm the head on the left with one of my arms holding up a dustpan and brush. <br>

    <!-- <h3>Caribbean Carnival Study Guide</h3>
        <p> I produced a study guide directing researchers to resources available at the
            <a href= "https://www.racearchive.org.uk/" target = "_blank">Ahmed Iqbal Ullah RACE Centre</a> about about Caribbean carnival and its cultural and historical
            contribution to Manchester and beyond.
            Coming Spring 2023.

        <h2> Cycling officer, Chit Chat Chai </h2>
        <h3>Autumn 2022</h3>
        <p> Cycling is cheap, fun, quick for short journeys and has a low environmental impact, but is still very
            inaccessible to most of the UK population. To help encourage active travel for Manchester's South Asian
            communities, I organised and delivered women-only cycle training for learners at
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chitchatchaiM16" target="_blank">Chit Chat Chai</a>, a project
            offering free basic women-only English in South Manchester and to local residents. This activity was funded
            by <a href="https://www.cyclinguk.org/bigbikerevival" target="_blank">Big Bike Revival</a> <br>

        <h2>Organiser, Over Here Zine Fest 2022</h2>
        <h3>Summer 2022</h3>
        <p>I organised the second Over Here Zine Fest, a zine fair showcasing the work of global majority creatives and
            makers with a focus on artists based in the north of England. Over Here took place in Manchester at the <a
                href="https://phm.org.uk/" target="_blank">People's History Museum</a> as part of its Migration theme.
            I also created my own zines for Over Here (see image below) which I sold and exchanged at the event.
            Zines included 'Have You Seen Milhouse?' about the time my cat went missing, and 'Eulogy', a tribute to my
            grandmother who passed away this year.<br><br>
