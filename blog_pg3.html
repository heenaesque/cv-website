                <h2>Review: Orfeo / Orpheus</h2>
                <h5>Lowry Lyric, Salford, Nov 19, 2022</h5>

                <p>When it comes to cultural events, opera still seems like an exclusive art form to me. That's why I
                    was interested in this production of Orpheus, a clever collaboration between Leeds-based companies
                    South Asian Arts UK and Opera North, but to be perfectly honest, I would not have gone unless my
                    friend had not got us some heavily discounted tickets. To call this production ambitious is a very
                    obvious thing to say, but it <i>was</i>. Parts were sung in the original Italian together with no
                    less than six separate South Asian languages (there were English titles, I'm no polyglot) and
                    featured live music played on instruments by musicians from Indian classical and European baroque disciplines. It
                    remained faithful to the original story of newlywed Orpheus trying to rescue his deceased wife from
                    the Underworld, but without its grisly ending (revealed to me afterwards with quiet glee by my friend's teenage son who was with us that evening). <br> <br> What did it mean to the majority British
                    South Asian audience to have their culture represented in this way on stage? I've recently been
                    thinking a lot about little space there is for the tales of British South Asian women, many of
                    whom have been here for decades. I'm not sure <i>Orpheus</i> would have resonated with their
                    experiences of oppression and resistance both inside and outside the home. Now that would be the perfect subject for an opera. So yes, I didn't LOVE it but I'm very glad I went and I'd like to go to the opera
                    again. Just give me the right story.</p>

                <h2>Review: The Color Purple</h2>
                <h5>Watched film 3 Nov 2022, read novel 1994 to 1996</h5>
                <img src="colorpurple.jpg" class="projects-landscape-image"
                    alt="Still from The Color Purple film of characters Celie and Shug in sparkly red costumes">
                <figcaption>Still from The Colour Purple Film. Whoopi Goldberg, left, as Celie with Margaret Avery,
                    right, as Shug.</figcaption><br>
                <p> It's been 40 years since the book the film is based on was published but its impact has not
                    diminished. I was
                    lucky enough to study this for novel as part of GCSE English Literature in the mid-1990s. I say
                    lucky because at the time Section 28 or Clause 28 of a piece of legislation the Local Government Act
                    was in full swing. It prohibited schools from teaching "the promotion of homosexuality" and "the
                    acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship". The wording of the legislation
                    was so vague
                    that teaching staff were often too scared to mention LGBT+ people at all in any part of schooling including pastoral care.
                    In this context, choosing The Color Purple as of our set texts was a risk, since the protagonist
                    Celie embarks on a lesbian relationship with Shug
                    Avery that is more loving and meaningful than any of the relationships she has with men in her life,
                    including her husband. I remember my English teacher warning us that the film adaptation is somewhat
                    sentimental and skirts over the nature of Celie and Shug's relationship. And now, almost thirty
                    years later, I got to decide for myself. I haven't read Alive Walker's novel since leaving school.
                    <br><br> The film brought the whole story flooding back. I love stories which, when you revisit
                    them, it's like seeing old friends again. This Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation feels very
                    faithful to the novel, probably because Walker acted as a consultant for the film. Clocking in at
                    two-and-a-half hours, it feels like very little was left out. What it says about gender,
                    sexuality, racism, misogynoir and the problems of white
                    feminism still hits hard. The story spans decades, continents and generations, packing so much in
                    that it feels
                    epic. When I told a film buff friend that I had recently watched this film, she informed me that it
                    did not win any Academy Awards that year. I checked and it had been nominated for eleven. Initially I was shocked, but then I considered the fact
                    that it tells a story about America that its white citizens weren't and aren't, even post-BLM, ready
                    to
                    hear. <br><br>
                    One book studied in English about feminism and racism for the whole time I was at school wasn't
                    enough to counter everything else I was taught in humanities lessons, religious instruction during daily assemblies and wider
                    culture. So maybe that's how my English teacher got away with teaching it and how English teachers still do. I'm grateful that I
                    got the chance to study it,
                    so thank you Angela Smith (not <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/member/1564/career"
                        target="_blank">this</a> feckless being), I know you tried. It wasn't enough but it was better
                    than nothing.
